A Selenium-based web-scraper that logs all the youtube videos I watched today in a csv file.

YouTube's current history page is really helpful if you want to see what videos you watched, however it has some limitations. 
If I want to see when I first watched a video, if I rewatched that video, then I wouldn't be able to see the first time I watched it. 
It also eliminates all the loading that you have to sit through when scrolling really far.
